lighttpd.conf is the configuration file for the lighttpd server
dp.pl should be placed in the root directory of the lighttpd server; it handles all client requests
perl_wrapper is the call to perl to handle requests from craq; it points to Berkeley DB libraries
  and therefore might need to be adjusted to compile on your machine

assuming that 'make' has been run, the lighttpd binary used to start the server is in 
  lighttpd_install/sbin/lighttpd

\section{Conclusions}
This paper presents the design and implementation of CRAQamo, a storage system built upon CRAQ, but is capable of mixing different consistency models. Moreover, the level of consistency can be tuned by the user in a Dynamo style. The key observation and motivation of CRAQamo is that not all operations are necessary to be strongly consistent, thus it is sometimes reasonable to adopt eventually consistency for non-critical operations. We demonstrate through experiments that CRAQamo can significantly reduce the latency, and increase the throughput, of CRAQ because of the constraint of strong consistency. We believe that real applications based on object storage systems can benefit from CRAQamo because of the flexibility of choosing consistency and the overall latency can be minimized to the largest extent.

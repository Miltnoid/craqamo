\begin{abstract}
Chain replication storage systems such as CRAQ\cite{terrace2009object} target at improving read throughputs for read-mostly workloads. However, write requests can only be handled by the head node of the chain, resulting in low write throughputs. Amazon's Dynamo\cite{decandia2007dynamo} sacrifices strong consistency for high availability, but only eventual consistency is achieved. Neither of these two systems finds the balance point between availability and consistency. From user's point of view, data objects are generally classified as critical and non-critical. Critical objects prefer strong consistency and low write throughput is acceptable, while eventual consistency is sufficient for non-critical objects, but high availability is preferred. Based on this observation, we propose CRAQamo, a storage system which supports strong consistency and eventual consistency at the same time.

\begin{abstract}
Chain replication storage systems such as CRAQ\cite{terrace2009object} target at improving read throughput and latency for read-mostly workloads. However, write requests can only be handled by the head node of the chain, resulting in low write throughput, and high latency. Amazon's Dynamo\cite{decandia2007dynamo} sacrifices strong consistency for high availability, throughput, and low latency, but only eventual consistency is achieved. Neither of these two systems finds the balance point between availability, consistency, and efficiency. From a user's point of view, operations are generally classified as critical and non-critical. Critical operations prefer strong consistency and low write throughput and high latency is acceptable, while eventual consistency is sufficient for non-critical operations, but high efficiency is preferred. Based on this observation, we propose CRAQamo, a storage system which supports strong consistency and eventual consistency at the same time.
